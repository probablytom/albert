An open-source children's story framework for improvised storytelling

Project Albert is a design pattern for easy improvisation of children's bedtime stories. 
The premise is simple: with a skeleton to build a story around that's flexible enough to fit an arbitrary scenario, but robust enough that any scenario will develop into *some* form of plot, any parent should be able to use Project Albert to create a story on a whim.

#Terms
This project borrows some terms from Computer Science, and discusses things that people might have slightly varying definitions for. Just so we're all on the same page, let's define some terms. 

##Design Pattern
A [design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern) is a way of managing the solutions to common problems. It's used in architecture and software engineering to discuss a solution to a problem that tends to be:
* Flexible enough to solve lots of problems that match some archetype
* Robust enough to be changed and still solve a problem 

It's my opinion that design patterns can also be useful in areas like operations management, interface design, writing, education, and other areas. It would be easier to count the areas where a solution to any problem that was robust and flexible wouldn't be helpful! Any area where lots of problems can arise, and solutions to those problems can be complex, design patterns have a place. 

`Albert` is a pattern for the improvisation of bedtime stories for children. It's designed to be quick to get used to for the storyteller, easy to take in for the child, and arbitrary enough that there's a near infinite number of stories that can be generated from it with ease. Albert's a way of producing stories that are engaging and calming from everyday events, without becoming stilted or tedious.

This page contains some pre-made stories contributed by Rebecca Baird. Thanks!

As always, anybody else is welcome to contribute stories of their own. 

These were made by Rebecca having just read the patterns through. Lady Petunia is her character that follows the Albert pattern. These match the pattern fairly closely, so they're a pretty good representation of what a story should look like.

##Lady Petunia and the Apple
</a>
Lady Petunia is a very wealthy donkey who lives just outside of London. She likes to wear her favourite pink hat when she goes apple picking in the orchard, and that is what she was doing today.
Lady Petunia had a very long journey to the orchard. It was on the other side of a huge, towering hill in a quiet valley, and the only way to get there was to walk, so she shined up her favourite shoes and put them on her little hooves, and began to walk.
First, she walked down her street, which was filled with identical little white houses. She waved to her neighbour Florence who was tending her garden, but Florence didn’t see – her head was in a rose bush. Next, she walked through the village market. She stopped to look at some pretty pink scarves which would match her hat, but she didn’t want to fill her basket before getting to the orchard, so she decided to pick them up on the way home.
Then she got to the hill. It really was very big, with a skinny little paths winding round leafy green trees. She followed the path for hours and hours, smiling at the birds singing in the sunshine.
Finally, she got to the orchard. The trees were laden with juicy, green apples, but there was one tree she was looking for in particular. This tree grew shiny red apples, the most delicious in her opinion. So she stretched her neck as far as she could and peered through the trees.
There it was!
She ran up to the tree – it was smaller than the others and the leaves were more triangular. It was very pretty. She carefully reached up and plucked a ruby red apple from the lowest branch. It looked so tasty, she couldn’t wait to eat it!
She filled the rest of her basket with green apples (she would use them to make a pie) and trotted back down the hill just as the sun began to set.
She passed back through the market and thought about getting the scarf to match her hat, but nothing looked as pretty compared to the apple which she had travelled so far to get, so she didn’t buy it.
She walked down her street again, very tired but satisfied, and returned to her quiet little house. Since she was so tired, she decided to make herself a lovely warm bubble bath before she ate her apple. It had, after all, been a very long journey.

##Lady Petunia and the Coffee Shop
</a>
Lady Petunia is a very wealthy donkey who lives just outside of London. She likes to wear her favourite pink hat when she goes into the city to meet her friends, and that is what she was doing today. 
Lady Petunia had a long journey into town. First, she had to walk to the train station to catch the morning train. She left five minutes early to make sure she didn’t miss it, and lucky too, because the queue for tickets was very long, and she had to run to make it!
After her train ride, which she spent looking outside at the pretty trees and houses turning into big city buildings, she had to get on the tube to Piccadilly Circus.
The tube station was very crowded! It was hot and smelly and Lady Petunia didn’t like it at all. When she got on the tube it whooshed through dark tunnels and Lady Petunia was quite scared.
But she got to Piccadilly just fine, and what a sunny afternoon it was! She met her friends in a teeny-tiny coffee shop which played tinkling piano music softly in the background. They complimented her hat and she felt so happy, she forgot about being scared of the tube.
On the way home, Lady Petunia didn’t feel scared whooshing through the tunnels – it was quite fun, like a rollercoaster. 
When she finally got back to her quiet little house, Lady Petunia was very tired, so she made herself up a lovely, warm bubble bath. It had, after all, been a very long journey.

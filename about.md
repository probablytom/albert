Welcome to Project Albert! 

Project Albert is a framework for improvising children's stories, created partly as an experiment in storytelling and partly to demonstrate the power patterns can have when they're applied properly. 

Project Albert has inspiration from two distinct sources: 

1. The stories I was told as a child. 

    My dad used to improvise my bedtime stories when I was a child; I've tried to reverse-engineer his process and turn it into a series of patterns, rules, and constraints, that guarentees as much as possible that the stories work (well!). 

2. Software engineering and project management

    Software engineering and project management have both begun making use of patterns for designing infrastructure and ensuring functionality. Patterns were first used like this in architecture, and the process of using patterns makes complex problems easier to parse and working solutions easier to create. 

The project is:

* In construction
* Really neat!
* Made by [Tom Wallis](http://blog.tomwallis.net)
* Going to rock when it's done.

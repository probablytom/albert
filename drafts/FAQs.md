####FAQs

* Project Albert is named after the main character: `Albert`. Albert is, by default for the pattern, a mild mannered friend of the storyteller from long ago. He is traditionally a penguin who lives in Surrey, for reasons that will be explained in the pattern later. 
* Albert can have any characteristics useful to the story being told, but also traditionally, Albert quite enjoys a nice, hot cup of tea. Again, this isn't necessary, but I'll explain why in the pattern later. (Besides, if he's a British penguin...)
* The Albert stories aren't suitable for everything. They're intended as short, fun little skits for bedtime. Albert stories would be badly suited to audiobook format for a five hour car journey through bland fields. He's a penguin, not Michael Bay. 
* The Albert stories aren't supposed to replace children's books. If anything, I'd advocate that more time spent reading to children is always a good thing! But there isn't always opportunity to whip out a copy of The Gruffalo, and being able to improvise a story is a good thing. 
* Project Albert isn't necessarily a complete framework for improvising stories. That's why it's made available for people to use and remix: the more people who take design patterns and bend them to their storytelling needs, the better our storytelling frameworks can get. There's a lot of room for improvement, and I'm excited to see what people create!

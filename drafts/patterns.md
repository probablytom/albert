#Patterns
Following is a list of the patterns used to construct a Project Albert story. Of course, it's not imperative that one uses all of the patterns, but using everything outlined ensures ease of improvisation and coherancy of story. It's got be easy to follow!

##Albert's World
Albert's world is a derivation of real life. This holds two purposes. Because we live in the real world, using it is: 
1. Easy to understand 
2. Very relateable
This doesn't mean it doesn't need work. In fact, Albert's world necessarily also consists of one detail that's amiss, and this is introduced at the beginning of the story. Using this means the world clearly is fictional, so disbelief is suspended from the beginning. This, in turn, serves two purposes: 
1. When the listener suspends disbelief, it feels like they're listening to a piece of fantasy, which can be more engaging than sitting to listen to a lecture about real-life events
2. When the storyteller spins their yarn, they need to have a little wriggle room to contradict themselves or miss out details. If the listener feels like they're listening to an account of real-life events, it's much more difficult to mention details previously left out. Generally, the extra flexibility from the suspension of disbelief means the storyteller will have more flexibility when coming up with story details on the fly.

So, the pattern creating Albert's world is built from two constraints:
1. It's based on real life
2. A single details is amiss, creating a fantasy feel

##Albert's Characters
Albert's characters can be fairly fluid, but constraining the way they are made with a design pattern can make the characters more believable for the listener and better fit into the world Albert's World lays out. 
1. Albert characters should have a defining characteristic that comes up at the same point in every story

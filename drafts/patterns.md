<!-- A list of patterns used in Project Albert. -->
#Patterns
Following is a list of the patterns used to construct a Project Albert story. Of course, it's not imperative that one uses all of the patterns, but using everything outlined ensures ease of improvisation and coherancy of story. It's got be easy to follow!

##The pattern itself
The Albert pattern is the application of the set of constraints below, in a story with the following structure:
* A simple beginning with exposition of a central plot point and a defining characteristic of the main character
* A progression from this exposition which is as simple as it can be, following any relevant internal monologue of the character the plot concerns
* A conclusion that rounds off events in a pleasant way, including a second defining characteristic of the main character
That's all! The constraints are mapped out below. 

For the purposes of application, be aware that, while all of the constraints relate to the story as a whole in at least one way, the constraints on the characters are really most relevant at the beginning of the story, and all three topics of constraints are more guidelines than hard-and-fast rules. By definition, design patterns are made to be tweaked to our requirements. However, where possible, they should be followed; they guarentee consistancy between stories, and attempt to maximise the listener's enjoyment of the story while minimising the pressure on the storyteller themselves.

##The constraints
These are the constraints one should bear in mind when creating an Albert story. Keep in mind that, while they might seem overbearing at first, they'll feel more natural with practice and will quickly become second nature when telling stories. 

These guidelines should change depending on your needs as a storyteller. Hopefully, you'll find that they propell your storytelling by making it easier to create engaging tales!

###Albert's World
Albert's world is a derivation of real life. This holds two purposes. Because we live in the real world, using it is: 
1. Easy to understand 
2. Very relateable
This doesn't mean it doesn't need work. In fact, Albert's world necessarily also consists of one detail that's amiss, and this is introduced at the beginning of the story. Using this means the world clearly is fictional, so disbelief is suspended from the beginning. This, in turn, serves two purposes: 
1. When the listener suspends disbelief, it feels like they're listening to a piece of fantasy, which can be more engaging than sitting to listen to a lecture about real-life events
2. When the storyteller spins their yarn, they need to have a little wriggle room to contradict themselves or miss out details. If the listener feels like they're listening to an account of real-life events, it's much more difficult to mention details previously left out. Generally, the extra flexibility from the suspension of disbelief means the storyteller will have more flexibility when coming up with story details on the fly.

So, the pattern creating Albert's world is built from two constraints:
1. It's based on real life
2. A single details is amiss, creating a fantasy feel

Also, note that the details about the world should not change story-to-story. A story in an Albert universe is a static, unchanging thing, making it easier to imerse a listener and have them suspend disbelief. It also makes stories coherant and leaves less work for the storyteller to do in working out exposition for the world.



###Albert's Characters
Albert's characters can be fairly fluid, but constraining the way they are made with a design pattern can make the characters more believable for the listener and better fit into the world Albert's World lays out. 

1. Albert characters should have a defining characteristic that comes up at the same point in every story. 
2. Albert characters should have no more than a couple of defining characteristics. 

The combination of these two factors means that Albert characters are relateable, but not complex. This makes Albert characters easy to follow, but also easy to improvise, which is clearly important to the goals of Project Albert. 

The set of details that define the character ground the character in the listener's mind. No Albert character needs to be fully fleshed out, because no Albert story should be long enough to require it. Furthermore, few details are needed to make characters engaging for a children's story. 
To cement the details in the listener's head and remind them of the character they know over time, the same details should be introduced at the beginning and end of the stories every time. For example, Albert himself should always be introduced as a penguin who lives in Surrey at the beginning of a story, and a story should always end with Albert enjoying "a nice, hot, cup of tea". Inflection can also help to make these details about the character relateable. While this might seem like an unnecesary detail, it appears very effective in practice.

When it comes to incidental details about the main character, there's no limit to how many you should include; whatever is applicable for the story you're spinning is fine. However, details shouldn't change in-story or story-to-story, because of the static world as mentioned in [[Albert's World]].



###Albert's plot

####Structure
Albert's plot structure revolves around two core ideas:

1. There should only be one plot point to develop
2. This single plot point should revolve around a single thing, whether that be an object or a feeling. 

So, for example, you could have a story about an umbrella seen in the window of a shop, or a stranger, but nothing else. 

A corollary of #1 is that the plot point should be developed by a (possibly potential) action of the main chracter's. So, Albert might want to buy the umbrella, or befriend the stranger, and this action or prospective action is what drives the story. 
Limiting plot points to only one keeps the story easy to both improvise and follow. If there's enough plot that various strands can coalesce together, there's too much plot to reasonably improvise. On a similar note, if there's enough plot for any meaningful theme to emerge, your plot may also be too complex. 


####Content
(
>Mundane(adj): From classical Latin *mundus*, meaning "universe, world", literally "clean, elegant", a transalation of Ancient Greek *kosmos*, in its Pythagorean sense of "the physical universe"

)[http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=mundane "Etymology of 'Mundane'"]

Albert content should be mundane, in both the etymological and ordinary sense of the word. It should be something relatively boring about the real world, that's also an integral and relateable part of the world. Things like shopping for fruit, a walk through the park, or grabbing a coffee with a friend are simple in nature, but lend themselves to little details like the weather or how nice the leaves on the ground looked that a complex or involved plot would lose. These details of the world are the etymologically mundane parts of an Albert plot. Following a mundane plot in the etymological and modern sense serves a couple of purposes:
* Stories are ordinary enough to be very easy to improvise, as it essentially becomes a narration of an hour of someone's ordinary day with passing detail thrown in 
  * For example, the character might pass the biscuit aisle and decide that they wouldn't buy biscuits today so they can lose some weight
* The plot follows a course of actions that the listener is at least partly familiar with, so the details become more interesting and the story is instantly recognisable
* Stories can focus on world and setting rather than action, so the story isn't driving forward so much as idly strolling through the plot. 
  * This is perfect for a children's bedtime story, which is the primary design of Project Albert.

While mundane content might sound like a strange constraint, it makes for a pleasantly ordinary and recognisable plot. This has worked brilliantly well in practice, and is really a core concept of an Albert story; without it, the stories can quickly become too complicated to effectively improvise. This isn't a constraint that's worth skipping!

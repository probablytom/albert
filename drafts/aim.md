#Aim

Being able to spin a yarn upon request is a skill we no longer require in a world of colourful children's books. However, it's a useful skill:
* Being able to improvise stories can bring people closer together
* Improvised stories can be more personal
* There's no financial cost involved in improvising stories!
* The memory of a personalised story can be more precious years later than the reading of a given book.

The aim of Project Albert is to create a generic framework for telling stories to very young children, and is an adaptation of the method my father used to improvise stories for me and my siblings (and his father with his children, too).
Project albert is a work in progress! Once it is finished, it'll include a series of design patterns that can be put together to construct worlds and stories simple enough to improvise and interesting enough to actually use. It's free to use and remix, given certain conditions!

## Design patterns
Project albert is an example of implementing `design patterns`.

A design pattern is a robust, flexible way to manage some process or system. It's a kind of skeleton we can design things around, where we can alter and change the skeleton to fit our needs. It's an architecture term from the '70s, but it's a term that's often used in software engineering too. 

A design pattern is a formula for solving some design problem that is both *robust* and *flexible*. It should be robust in that it can solve any problem that fits a given format, without much modification. When we say flexible, we mean that the pattern should be changeable enough that any problem which can be made to fit that format, the design pattern should be easily modifiable enough that that problem can be solved by a modified version of the design pattern. 

So, when we talk about design patterns, we really mean a general structure that can be changed to solve a specific problem depending on the context, where the amount you need to change your pattern is related to how different your problem is to what the design pattern's supposed to solve.

##Motivation
Not all families can afford children's books, and not all families want to put their money into narratives for their children. While Albert isn't intended to ever replace children's books, it does give parents an easy way to construct a new story for their children at short notice, without needing to develop any great amount of skill as a storyteller. Albert's a step on the road to empowering people with a way to tell stories, without needing to put in the time, effort, and introspection to become a significantly skilled weaver of tales. 
Specifically, Albert isn't intended to be a skeleton for the construction of long stories, nor stories intended for adults. It is simplistic in its form and humble in what it aims to stretch to, but the hope is that design patterns can become more widely used and help to create more interesting and exciting things over time. 
One could even consider Albert a proof-of-concept of the power of design patterns as applied to everyday life as a whole.

##OK Coach, I'm ready! Throw me into the ring!
Let's get started on Project Albert itself, shall we?

####Wait...what does a design pattern even look like?
A design pattern usually looks like a series of steps or conditions. In Computer Science, we have a special language for diagramming how systems should be constructed and behave (`UML`), but we don't have to worry about that right now. For outlining the Project Albert design pattern, I'll just use a collection of rules.


####The Albert Pattern 
* Albert's identity is consistent through different stories. 
So, for example, if the first time you tell the Albert story, Albert is a penguin from Sussex, Albert should always be a pengiun from Sussex. 
* Albert's identity is at least a little silly.
Albert is the first part of the world a child is going to become familiar with, so introducing Albert as something founded in reality but keeping him a little goofy makes the world both relateable and makebelieve. This is good for two reasons: it makes things easier for the storyteller if the world doesn't actually have to be entirely realistic, and

An example of a design pattern from software design occurs when you give a computer an input, and the programmer doesn't know exactly what they might want to do with it. So, they have the computer construct a virtual pipe that the input travels down, and tell the computer that, at different stages of the pipe, the computer should make changes to the information in different ways. Like a real copper pipe and some apples rolling through it. If you put some water at the beginning of the pipe, and some sugar at the end, the apple would get wet at first and then get sugar stuck to it. The computer design pattern is to create these virtual pipes, and then add different things to do to the appl

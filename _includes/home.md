# Welcome to Project Albert.

In the beginning, a wild, untamed mankind would hunt prey and sit around a fire and tell stories in the warm glow, painting their memories onto the walls of their homes. 

In the end, when a tamed mankind breathes its dying breaths, we will huddle around the last vestiges of warmth we can find, and share stories of days past, when men were wild and the ground was alive, and we painted the walls with our fingers. 

In the meantime, we keep cosy and warm in our beds, and as we tuck the next generation into slumber they ask to be told a story. 

Stories were the beginning of us, and they will wave us goodbye. In the meantime, we share tales of the psat and visions of the future and stories of our own inventions. But some of us aren't as good at creating worlds of fiction as others. For the people who have use of tapping into the human response to the story, but aren't a natural-born yarn weaver, let me present Project Albert.

## What is Project Albert?


Project Albert is an attempt to create a framework, which makes it easy to improvise children's bedtime stories. It's in constant development -- contributions can be made on the [Github project page](http://github.com/probablytom/albert/). 

Project Albert works by laying out a pattern that a story can be designed using. This pattern acts as a skeleton that a story can be constructed with, and it's actually a technique borrowed from software engineering and architecture. [Design Patterns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) make this skeleton flexible enough that it can be changed to fit any needs (within reason), and robust enough to still work even when it's changed. 

Project Albert isn't intended to replace children's books, or to take away reading in any capacity. It's a foray into new ways of storytelling, and showing that, while software engineering and storytelling aren't so similar, they have core similarities that mean they can learn from each other. In time, I'm sure, design patterns will be further integrated into parts of life like storytelling much more. They're powerful, and natural to use.

## Support

You can contribute by heading to the [Github project page](http://github.com/probablytom/albert/) and filing an issue or making a pull request. If you just want to leave comments, please do! You can email at *projectalbert-AT-tomwallis-DOT-net*.

Contributions can be made to both the code of the site and the content. This site is hosted using Github Pages and made using Jekyll and Markdown. It's pretty basic and still in its infancy

I make Project Albert in my spare time, and as a student in his final year, spare time is thin on the ground. If you think this is neat, or you want this and things like it to be made, please donate! I buy food with bitcoin and every little helps; in return, I'll keep this maintained and create more projects that bridge the gaps between diverse fields. 

*Thank you for your support.*

# Welcome to Project Albert.

Stories are a foundational aspect of the human experience. They're the things we hear when we're young, tell when we're old, and make in between. 

Stories are *important*. But it can be hard, sometimes, to tell a fresh story: books are expensive, and you can't always pull something new from the back of your head. 

Project Albert tries to make this easier, by creating patterns we can follow so we can get the semantics and structure out of the way and get on to actually creating our stories. 

The Albert patterns focus on children's bedtime stories, and attempt to make storytelling easy enough to improvise, whenever they're needed.

## What is Project Albert?


Project Albert is an attempt to create a framework, which makes it easy to improvise children's bedtime stories. It's in constant development -- contributions can be made on the [Github project page](http://github.com/probablytom/albert/). 

Project Albert works by laying out a pattern that a story can be designed using. This pattern acts as a skeleton that a story can be constructed with, and it's actually a technique borrowed from software engineering and architecture. [Design Patterns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) make this skeleton flexible enough that it can be changed to fit any needs (within reason), and robust enough to still work even when it's changed. 

Project Albert isn't intended to replace children's books, or to take away reading in any capacity. It's a foray into new ways of storytelling, and showing that, while software engineering and storytelling aren't so similar, they have core similarities that mean they can learn from each other. In time, I'm sure, design patterns will be further integrated into parts of life like storytelling much more. They're powerful, and natural to use.

## Support

You can contribute by heading to the [Github project page](http://github.com/probablytom/albert/) and filing an issue or making a pull request. If you just want to leave comments, please do! You can email at *projectalbert-AT-tomwallis-DOT-net*.

Contributions can be made to both the code of the site and the content. This site is hosted using Github Pages and made using Jekyll and Markdown. It's pretty basic and still in its infancy

I make Project Albert in my spare time, and as a student in his final year, spare time is thin on the ground. If you think this is neat, or you want this and things like it to be made, please donate! I buy food with bitcoin and every little helps; in return, I'll keep this maintained and create more projects that bridge the gaps between diverse fields. 

*Thank you for your support.*

Welcome to Project Albert! 
This project aims to create a set of design patterns for improvising children's bedtime stories. 
The posts in the sidebar try to give an overview of the project, and how to implement it. Over time, it should get fleshed out with example stories using the patterns and variations on the process people have made. 

On the note of varying the process, note that the whole project is open source and designed to be remixed. You can find a link to the GitHub project in the sidebar. If you find this useful, please do make a pull request with any additions to the project! If you're non-technical or uninterested in learning git, feel free to email suggestions at projectalbert-AT-tomwallis.net. 


Enjoy, and happy storytelling!

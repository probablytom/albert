#Welcome to Project Albert

Project Albert is a pattern for improvising children's stories with a consistant world and interesting, relateable characters. It doesn't lose the magic of a fantasy world, but allows people to create more meaningful memories through a personal, unique story. 

Albert isn't supposed to be a replacement for children's books -- it's a solution for the problem of affording books, and can be altered depending on the needs of the audience and the storyteller, too. 

Have fun!

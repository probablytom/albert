Project Albert is a bit of a weird one. 

What we're trying to build isn't a replacement for children's books, but it also isn't supposed to be an end product. 

It's a trial of something new: a different way of blending what we've learned about the sciences and the humanities. The two are brought together too little. It strikes me as strange: sciences can be so cold and unapproachable, with their jargon and rigor; arts can seem so abstract, with their ambiguity and intense breadth; combinations of the two are all too infrequent, and often, the technical side is prone to breaking or the artistic side is unrelatable. 

This tries to take a different approach. The focus here is to create an expos√© on how a very small section of the humanities (improvising childrens' bedtime stories) can be enhaced using things we know from computer science. Design patterns are the tip of a fascinating iceberg, and one of many: what can computer science learn from storytelling, or physics learn from art, or music learn from chemistry? The combination of studies is vital to sharing our wealth of knowledge as a people.

Let's not reinvent the wheel. If we've figured something out in one area, let's find ways to share it with other disciplines and trades.

Project Albert is to show one way in which this can happen. It's not supposed to be perfect, and it might never be used, but with some support and input, it could be great. Anyone can contribute! In the meantime, let's explore the ways sciences and humanities can help each other in other ways, too. 

<br/>This is only the beginning.
